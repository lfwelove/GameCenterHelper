GameCenterHelper
================

Helper classes for adding Game Center functionality to quick-cocos2dx projects based on Steffen Itterheim's 'Game Kit Helper' and Steve Barnegren's 'GameKitHelperCpp'.

Use GKHWrapperOC.mm to subit scores, achievements, load views, and generally communicate with Game Center.

GKHWrapperOC is a wrapper for lua scripts.

For a more in depth guide on how to use this class, see my blog post at http://www.gleejit.com/1/post/2014/04/quick-cocos2dx-game-center.html
